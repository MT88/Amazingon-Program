/*  The goal of this application, and there may need to be several applications,
is to condense all of my business operations for E-Commerce all
into one place.*/

//  List of operations that currently take place for business are as follows:

//  Sourcing and Ordering of Products -----------------------------------------------------------** 2

//  Listing/Uploading of products on online stores (Amazon/Ebay/Hopefully my own site) -----------------** 3

//  Inventory tracking for Amazon with Inventory Lab. Ebay has an Excel sheet.  -------------------------** 1

//  Creating of shipments for Amazon. Inventory Lab generates a file and uploads it for Amazon.

/*  ACCOUNTING: Inventory Lab also does the accounting.
The program tracks expenses and income for tax purposes.
Tax Liabilities are accounted for in Inventory Lab.
With Nexus Law changes it will be necessary to more closely track both quantity of sales
in all 50 states and the ammount of revenue produced from all 50 states in real time.
Accounting for Ebay is only done on an Excel sheet. You can imagine how bad it would
be for my company to cross one of the Tax Liability thresholds on Ebay and be in
very big trouble for not filing taxes like I was supposed to.

/*  Marketing:  I would like to have an in house marketing setup. I would like to be able to generate
A/B split test lead pages and an Email auto responder to keep customers informed about the business.
In doing this I accomplish the task of at least three different applications and I can offer marketing
services to other businesses as well. Note; this may be part of the overall website that gets created.
*/

/*  Systematic Liquidation Sales: I would like to liquidate all assets that have not sold
or are not selling after 3 months automatically. This would look like an automatic, constantly
running liquidation sale.
*/

/*  Last but not least, Displaying of products on an independent website where they can be
browsed and purchased directly.*/
